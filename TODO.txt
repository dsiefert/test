modify description for items to use a proper DSL, as in:
	add_movable(*args) do |m|
		m.listen_for :tread do |me|
			me.method
		end
	end
level discription dsl, as in:
	DungeonLevel.design do |l|
		l.background :grass
		l.random :tree, 0.2

		l.clearing shape: elipse, x: 39, y: 12, radius: 8
figure out method of specifying level discription in advance of making it, so I can specify a bunch of them without it having to generate all of them at once at the beginning
